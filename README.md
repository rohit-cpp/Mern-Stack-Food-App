# 🍔 FoodieHub – MERN Stack Food E-Commerce Website

Welcome to **FoodieHub**, my **first full-fledged MERN stack project** – a fully functional food eCommerce website. This app is built with **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. It allows users to explore food items by category, add them to the cart, and simulate a modern e-commerce experience.

🚀 **Project Status:** Completed and **deployed**  
📅 **Duration:** Completed in **4–5 days**

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

As this was my **first MERN stack project**, I faced several challenges along the way:

- **🧠 Learning Curve**: Understanding how to structure a full-stack project from scratch.
- **🔄 State Syncing**: Managing cart quantities and keeping UI in sync with the backend.
- **🛠️ Context API Debugging**: I ran into issues like:
  - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_id')`  
  - Cart buttons not updating due to missing product IDs in state
- **🧪 Testing & Debugging**: Fixing silent bugs in cart logic, especially when quantities weren’t updating correctly.
- **🚚 Deployment**: Deploying the frontend and backend separately and connecting them using environment variables and CORS.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Building reusable React components
- Managing app-wide state with Context API
- Connecting frontend with MongoDB via Express/Node
- Handling async operations and API integration
- Deploying full-stack apps confidently
